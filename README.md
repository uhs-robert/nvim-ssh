I personally prefer using yazi for this functionality, you can check out my fully tested method here: [sshfs.yazi](https://github.com/uhs-robert/sshfs.yazi).

## Next Steps for Repo

I am planning to revamp this in the next coming weeks to make it functional again based on my work from sshfs.yazi. It should be a fairly easy job. Stay tuned!
