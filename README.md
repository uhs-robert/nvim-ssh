# nvim-ssh
Use sshfs to mount remote servers in nvim for editing and viewing

## Disclaimaer
This is an old repository and I haven't tested this in awhile. I personally prefer using yazi for this functionality as it is my preferred way to browse files via [sshfs.yazi](https://github.com/uhs-robert/sshfs.yazi).

However I am planning to revamp this in the next coming weeks to make it functional again. If you're reading this, then check back around September 2025.
